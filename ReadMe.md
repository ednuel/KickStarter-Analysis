# Kickstarter challenge

## To see how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### For Outcomes Bases on Launch Dates how we built the graph was by gathering the parent categories then filtering it to only show theater for all the years. After that we separating the data further by months and filtering the rest of the date by successful, failed, canceled, and the grand total. With Outcomes Bases on Goals we gather the information on the total amount of plays then we separated the data with the plays money goals. After filter it more by successful, failed, and canceled to find the percentage of the plays that where successful, failed, or canceled.

## Results for both Theater outcomes vs Launch dates and Outcomes based on goals

### We come to the conclusion that outcomes bases on their goals and theater outcomes bases on launch date canceled projects stayed consistent on both ends. 

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goal

### With the Theater Outcomes Bases on Launch Date information we can come to the conclusion that if your launch date is based on the Summer the numbers of success if at its highest. While, if the theater launch date is based in the Winter where the success is at its lowest. 

### If your Goal is around the range of $45000 to $49999 your success rate is at the lowest, which is zero percent. Whereas, if your goal for a play is $4999 or lower your success rate with this date is over 70%.

### Outliers will always be a challenge when it comes to collecting data. For example, on our theater outcomes bases on launch date there where no canceled data on the month of October.


### We could have filter a specific year if Louis just wants to compare her project that year to other projects during the same year.
